# Final Project: Serverless Web Application and API
In the final project, you will have the opportunity to take your serverless and microservices skills and put them into action in a project that combines these technologies into a single web application.  
You will create a serverless web application -- a simple guestbook website where users can post messages -- and you will host the website in two different ways.
