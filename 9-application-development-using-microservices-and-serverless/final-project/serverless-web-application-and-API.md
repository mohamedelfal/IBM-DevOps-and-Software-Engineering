# Final Project: Serverless Web Application and API
In the final project, you will have the opportunity to take your serverless and microservices skills and put them into action in a project that combines these technologies into a single web application.  
You will create a serverless web application -- a simple guestbook website where users can post messages -- and you will host the website in two different ways.

**Learning Objectives**  
Deploy a serverless backend and a database  
Expose a rest API  
Host a static website using object storage  
Deploy the static website as a microservice on Red Hat OpenShift   
   
**Troubleshooting**   
If at any point the IBM Cloud Functions UI doesn't seem up to date, perform a hard refresh of the webpage.    
In many browsers this is accomplished by clickng on the refresh button while holding the shift key.
